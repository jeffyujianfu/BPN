As problems in political polarization and the spread of misinformation become serious, belief
propagation on a social network becomes an important question to explore. Previous breakthroughs
have been made in algorithmic approaches to understanding how group consensus or polarization
can occur in a population. A new model of belief propagation is introduced that tries to
explain the underlying stuborness of individual as well as possible back fire effect by treating each
individual as a single layer neural network on a set of evidence for a particular statement with
input being confidence level on each evidence, and belief of the statment is the output of this
neural network. People influence eachother through stating their beliefs directly but also through
propagating confidence level on a set of evidence. The weights of the neural network is interpreted
as the structure of understanding an individual has on a particular statement.
